# Railway Travel Company 

## Project Overview: 
I have just been hired as a data analyst to help start a company that will focus on booking railway travel.

I have access to a dataset that contains valuable country information, including gross domestic product (GDP), the extent of railway infrastructure, ease of doing business score, and more.

I have been asked to use this data to make a data-driven recommendation as to which country the business should select to launch its startup.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

To succeed in this endeavor, i considered various factors that can influence the business's success such as:

- Should Railway Travel Coy prioritize a country with a high GDP or one with a favorable ease of doing business score?

- How might the presence of railways and the number of passengers affect the business?

- How important is the number of incoming international visitors?

The team has shared the following factors with me, in order of importance:

- Current usage of the existing railways.

- Total length of existing railways.

- GDP per capita.

- Ease of conducting business.

## DATA SOURCE

The dataset used for this analysis is World Development Indicators which is attached below:
